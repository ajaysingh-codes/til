# Today I Learned (TIL)

A collection of concise write-ups documenting my daily learning journey across various technologies. Each entry represents something new I've discovered, built, or understood more deeply.

## 🎯 Learning Paths

Choose your journey based on your goals:

### Path 1: AI Pair Programming Mastery
*Perfect for developers wanting to boost productivity with AI coding assistants*

1. **Start Here** → [Cursor Guide](ai-pair-programming/cursor.md) `⏱️ 15 min` `🟢 Beginner`
2. **Level Up** → [Claude Code Guide](ai-pair-programming/claude-code.md) `⏱️ 20 min` `🟡 Intermediate`
3. **Advanced** → [Cursor Cheat Sheet](ai-pair-programming/cursor-cheatsheet.md) `⏱️ 5 min` `🟢 Quick Reference`

**What you'll learn:** Master AI-powered code editors, context management, and advanced features like agents and hooks

### Path 2: Building AI Tools with MCP
*For those who want to create custom AI integrations and extend LLM capabilities*

1. **Start Here** → [MCP Resources & Prompts Guide](MCP/README.md) `⏱️ 25 min` `🟡 Intermediate`
2. **Quick Reference** → [MCP Cheat Sheet](MCP/mcp-cheatsheet.md) `⏱️ 5 min` `🟢 Quick Reference`

**What you'll learn:** Build custom MCP servers, understand resources vs prompts vs tools, and connect AI agents to external systems

### Path 3: Complete AI Developer Stack
*The full journey from using AI tools to building them*

1. [Cursor Guide](ai-pair-programming/cursor.md) → Master your AI coding environment
2. [Claude Code Guide](ai-pair-programming/claude-code.md) → Advanced AI pair programming
3. [MCP Guide](MCP/README.md) → Build custom AI integrations
4. Apply your knowledge to real projects!
